    "question": "How does the AI Act differentiate between 'real-time' and 'post' biometric identification systems?",
    "answer": "### Differentiation Between 'Real-Time' and 'Post' Biometric Identification Systems\n\nThe AI Act makes clear distinctions between 'real-time' and 'post' remote biometric identification systems, particularly in terms of their intrusiveness, use cases, and regulatory safeguards.\n\n#### Real-Time Remote Biometric Identification:\n- **Definition**: Involves the immediate processing of video footage to identify individuals as soon as they appear.\n- **Intrusiveness**: Considered highly intrusive as it can affect a large portion of the population by evoking feelings of constant surveillance. This may indirectly dissuade people from exercising their freedom of assembly and other fundamental rights ([37, pages: 9](#)).\n- **Technical Issues**: Potential for technical inaccuracies leading to biased results and discriminatory effects.\n- **Regulations**: Subject to strict conditions to ensure that any use is proportionate, legitimate, and strictly necessary. This includes targeting specific individuals, locations, and time frames based on legally acquired data ([37, pages: 25](#)).\n- **Purpose of Use**: Limited to serious criminal offenses where its use is foreseeable to be necessary and proportionate for locating or identifying suspects ([37, pages: 10](#)).\n\n#### Post-Retrieval Remote Biometric Identification:\n- **Definition**: Involves analyzing previously recorded video footage rather than processing it in real-time.\n- **Intrusiveness**: While also intrusive, safeguards are recommended to ensure its use is proportionate and legitimate, specifically targeting identified individuals based on closed data sets of legally acquired footage ([37, pages: 25](#)).\n- **Regulations**: Use should not lead to indiscriminate surveillance. There must be strict conditions ensuring that post-retrieval systems do not circumvent the rules set for real-time identification systems ([37, pages: 25](#)).\n\nIn summary, while both types of biometric systems are considered intrusive, 'real-time' systems pose a greater risk due to their immediate and broad application in public spaces. As such, they face stricter regulations regarding when and how they can be deployed. Post-retrieval systems are similarly regulated but with slightly different considerations given the temporal separation between data capture and analysis.\n\nThese insights are based on the provided documents ([37, pages: 9](#), [37, pages: 25](#))."
